# Feature Breakdown
    API Documentation
        The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to promote clarity and ease of integration for third-party developers. Both REST and GraphQL endpoints are available, with Django REST Framework supporting structured CRUD operations and GraphQL providing more flexible data querying.

    User Authentication
        Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles via endpoints like /users/ and /users/{user_id}/. This feature ensures secure access control and personalized experiences for guests and hosts.

    Property Management
        Through endpoints such as /properties/ and /properties/{property_id}/, users (hosts) can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables hosts to manage their rentals and guests to browse available properties.

    Booking System
        The booking feature allows users to reserve properties, manage their bookings, and handle check-in/check-out information. Endpoints like /bookings/ and /bookings/{booking_id}/ enable smooth interaction between guests and hosts.

    Payment Processing
        Payment transactions are handled securely through the /payments/ endpoint. This feature ensures that users can pay for bookings efficiently and that transactions are tracked and validated.

    Review System
        Guests can leave feedback on properties via /reviews/ and /reviews/{review_id}/. This fosters trust within the platform by allowing users to share experiences and hosts to improve their service based on reviews.

    Database Optimizations
        The system implements indexing on frequently queried fields for faster data access and uses caching to reduce database load and enhance performance. These optimizations ensure the platform remains responsive under heavy usage.

# API Security
    Authentication
        The project uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or Django Token Auth) to verify user identity for accessing protected endpoints. Only authenticated users can perform sensitive operations like making bookings or posting reviews.

        Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures that only verified users can interact with the system.

    Authorization
        Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host). For instance, only property owners can modify their listings, and only guests can book properties.

        Why it matters: Ensures users can only perform actions permitted by their role, reducing the risk of data tampering or misuse.

    Rate Limiting
        Rate limiting is applied to all public-facing APIs to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Tools like Django Ratelimit or API gateways are used to throttle requests from a single IP or user.

        Why it matters: Protects the backend from being overwhelmed by excessive or malicious requests.

    Data Encryption
        All data transmission is secured using HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption. Sensitive information such as passwords and payment data is stored securely and never transmitted in plain text.

        Why it matters: Protects sensitive data from being intercepted or exposed during transmission or at rest.

    Input Validation & Sanitization
        All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other common vulnerabilities. Backend validations complement frontend checks to ensure system integrity.

        Why it matters: Maintains data integrity and protects the system from injection-based exploits and corrupted data entries.


# CI/CD Pipeline

    Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes. They ensure that every update pushed to the repository is automatically validated and deployed in a reliable, consistent manner.

    CI/CD pipelines help:
        Catch bugs early through automated testing.
        Streamline deployment processes and reduce manual errors.
        Maintain consistent development, staging, and production environments.
        Improve collaboration and accelerate delivery of new features.

    Tools used: GitHub Actions, Docker, Celery + Redis, PostgreSQL, Cloud platforms.
