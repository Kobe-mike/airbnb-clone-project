# Team Roles

    backend-developer
        Ensures that the application has reliable business logic, handles user requests efficiently, and securely manages data communication between frontend and backend layers.
        Responsibility:
        Implements server-side application logic.
        Designs and develops RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
        Integrates third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services).
        Works closely with the frontend team to ensure seamless data exchange.
        Maintains clean, scalable code adhering to best practices and design patterns.

    Database Administrator (DBA)
        Provides a robust, efficient, and secure foundation for storing and retrieving application data. Collaborates closely with backend developers to optimize database access.
        Responsibility:
        Designs the database schema aligned with business requirements.
        Manages data integrity, indexing, normalization, and query optimization.
        Ensures data security, backup strategies, and disaster recovery plans.
        Monitors performance and resolves database bottlenecks.

    DevOps Engineer
        Automates deployment workflows, maintains server uptime, and ensures the application runs smoothly in various environments (staging, production, etc.).
        Responsibility:
        Sets up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment and integration.
        Manages infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible.
        Monitors performance using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
        Ensures system scalability, reliability, and high availability.
        Handles containerization and orchestration with tools like Docker and Kubernetes.

    QA Engineer
        Guarantees the backend is stable, secure, and meets the required functional and non-functional standards before release.
        Responsibility:
        Writes and runs automated and manual tests for backend logic and APIs.
        Uses tools like Postman, JUnit, or Selenium to test endpoints and functionality.
        Validates performance, security, and edge case handling.
        Collaborates with developers to resolve bugs and ensure new features donâ€™t introduce regressions.


# Technology Stack
This project uses the following technologies to build, run, and maintain the backend system:

    Django
        A high-level Python web framework used for building robust and scalable RESTful APIs, handling core backend logic, and managing the overall application structure.

    Django REST Framework (DRF)
        An extension of Django that provides a powerful toolkit for building and managing RESTful APIs, including authentication, serialization, and request/response handling.

    PostgreSQL
        A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data efficiently and securely.

    GraphQL
        A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving flexibility and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data

    Celery
        An asynchronous task queue used to handle background tasks such as sending notifications, processing long-running jobs, or managing scheduled tasks.

    Redis
        An in-memory data structure store used for caching, session management, and as a message broker for Celery tasks to ensure fast performance.

    Docker
        A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production.

    CI/CD Pipelines
        Automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying code changes to ensure fast, reliable, and repeatable delivery to production environments.
